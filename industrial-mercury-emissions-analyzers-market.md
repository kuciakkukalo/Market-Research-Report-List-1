<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Mercury Emissions Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption</li><li>Cold Atomic Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Mercury Emissions Analyzers market features primarily two types: Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA) and Cold Atomic Fluorescence (CAF) techniques. CVAA is a widely-used method that quantifies mercury levels through the absorption of light by mercury vapor, providing high sensitivity and accuracy. In contrast, CAF utilizes the fluorescence emitted by mercury atoms when excited by light, allowing for real-time monitoring with lower detection limits. Both methods play critical roles in environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance for mercury emissions.</p></p>
